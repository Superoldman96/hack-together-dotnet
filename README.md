Whether you created a project or learned along with the live streams - we want to say thank you 🙏 for coming along on this learning journey with us. You don't have to stop learning though - you can follow us at the [.NET YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@dotnet) or take free, online, self-paced training with [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/browse/?products=dotnet).

Now - without further ado the winners are:

* Best overall: [NASA TechPort Headlines](https://github.com/tagr/greatnet8hack-techport)
* Best AI: [Betakads](https://github.com/ZadokJoshua/betakads-avalonia-app)
